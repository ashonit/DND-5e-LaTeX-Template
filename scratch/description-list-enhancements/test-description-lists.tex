\section{Regular Text}

This section demonstrates description lists in regular paragraph text. Description lists are commonly used throughout D\&D documents to define terms, list equipment properties, and explain game mechanics.

\begin{description}
  \item[Armor Class] Your defense against attacks.
  \item[Hit Points] How much damage you can take.
  \item[Speed] How far you can move in one turn.
\end{description}

The following changes were made to improve description list formatting:

\begin{description}
  \item[listparindent] Set to 0pt to eliminate problematic first-line indentation.
  \item[itemindent] Set to 0pt to prevent item content from being indented.
  \item[leftmargin] Adjusted to match context - 12pt for boxes, minimal for regular text.
  \item[labelsep] Set to 1em to ensure proper spacing between labels and content.
  \item[topsep] Maintained at 6pt for consistent vertical spacing.
\end{description}
